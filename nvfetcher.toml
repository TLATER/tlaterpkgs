# EDOPro obviously has a GitHub repo, but it's not really possible to
# build the artifacts downstream. They instead publish full
# applications as tarballs on a separate "assets" repo.

# Unfortunately, not all versions are built for all platforms, so we
# need to scrape the website to figure out what the latest Linux
# version is.
